# Spotfire Hospital Data Management Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into patient clinical outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and financial performance across various encounters. It serves as a centralized tool for healthcare administrators and clinical analysts to monitor key metrics, identify trends, and optimize care delivery and cost management.

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

The dashboard is structured into three main analytical pages, each focusing on a distinct area of hospital operations and patient care.

---

## 1. Patient Admission & Encounter Analytics (Snapshot not provided, but assumed)

* **Purpose:** To provide an overview of patient demographics, admission trends, length of stay, and initial diagnosis patterns. This page typically helps in understanding patient flow and operational efficiency.
* **Key Visualizations (Inferred):**
    * **Time Series Charts:** Admissions/Discharges by month/year.
    * **Bar Charts:** Distribution of patient demographics (Age, Gender, Location).
    * **Tables:** Top 'N' reasons for admission (Primary Diagnosis).

---

## 2. Treatment Effectiveness & Clinical Outcomes

This page focuses on the clinical journey of patients, comparing vital signs, lab results, and treatment details between admission and discharge to assess the effectiveness of care.

| Section | Purpose | Key Visualizations & Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vitals** | Monitor changes in key vital signs from **Admission** (Red line) to **Discharge** (Green line) across selected Encounters. | **Line Charts:** Diastolic BP, Heart Rate, O2 Sat, Resp Rate, Systolic BP, Temperature. **Goal:** Identify improvements or stability in patient condition. |
| **Lab Test** | Track the values of crucial laboratory tests upon admission and discharge. | **Scatter Plot:** CBC, Chem, CRP, Lipids (Y-axis: Value; X-axis: Encounter ID and Status). **Goal:** Assess the impact of treatment on objective physiological markers. |
| **Treatment Details** | A detailed table listing the diagnosis, disease type, and the specific treatments (Drug, Therapy, Surgery) administered to the patient in the selected encounters. | **Table:** Encounter ID, Admission Diagnosis, Disease Type, Treatment Type, Treatment Name (e.g., Aspirin, Statins, Olmesartol). |
| **Special Test** | Visualize the results of specialized diagnostic tests. | **Scatter Plot:** D-Dimer, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), LDLP Gene Mutation Test, Synovial Fluid Analysis. **Goal:** Monitor markers related to specific conditions (e.g., D-Dimer for thrombosis, ESR for inflammation). |
| **Encounter Selector** | Allows the user to select specific patient encounters (`Encounter ID`) to filter all charts and tables on the page. | **List Box:** Filtering mechanism for granular analysis. |

## 3. Financial Performance & Cost of Care

This page provides an in-depth view of the financial aspects of care, focusing on treatment costs, insurance coverage, and resource utilization (room occupancy).

| Section | Purpose | Key Visualizations & Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Treatment & Insurance Details** | Correlates administered treatments with the insurance plan type to analyze potential cost differences or coverage gaps. | **Table:** Encounter ID, Treatment Type, Treatment Name, Insurance Plan Name (Basic/Premium). **Key Insight:** Understanding which treatments are used under different insurance tiers. |
| **Room Type vs Occupancy by month** | Analyzes resource utilization by tracking the number of rooms occupied for each room type over the year. | **Heatmap/Treemap:** Y-axis: Occupancy by Month; X-axis: Room Type (Deluxe, Standard, Suite). **Color:** No. of Rooms Occupied in a Month (ranging from Min to Max). **Key Insight:** Hospital capacity planning and demand patterns. |
| **Cost Distribution** | Breaks down the **Total Cost** of care into its major contributing categories. | **Treemap:** Area represents the proportion of cost. Categories include: **SurgeryCost**, **RoomCost**, **DrugCost**, **AdditionalFees**, **RadianceFees**, **Chemo**, **PsychologicalSupport**, and **NutritionCost**. **Key Insight:** Identify the largest cost drivers. |
| **Total Cost Vs Insurance Coverage** | A high-level summary of the total billed amount versus the amount covered by insurance. | **Pie Chart/Donut Chart:** **Total Cost** (e.g., 59.9%) vs. **Insurance Coverage** (e.g., 40.1%). **Key Insight:** Financial viability and out-of-pocket costs for patients. |

## 💡 How to Use the Dashboard

1.  **Select Encounters:** Start by using the **Encounter ID** filter (in the **Treatment Effectiveness** page) to focus on a specific patient or a group of patients.
2.  **Analyze Clinical Outcomes:** Use the **Vitals** and **Lab Test** charts to quickly determine if the patient's condition improved between admission and discharge.
3.  **Evaluate Cost Drivers:** Switch to the **Financial Performance** page to see how the treatments administered contributed to the overall **Cost Distribution** and the patient's **Insurance Coverage**.
4.  **Operational Review:** Use the **Room Type vs Occupancy** chart to understand how busy the hospital was during a particular period.
